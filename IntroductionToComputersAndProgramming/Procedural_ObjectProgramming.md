### Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming
Procedural programming involves the programmer constructing procedures (or functions, as they are called in C++). The procedures each contain their own variables and commonly share variables with other procedures.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is centered on the object. An object is a programming element that contains data and the procedures that operate on the data. It is a self-contained unit.

The objects contain, within themselves, both information and the ability to manipulate the information. Operations are carried out on the information in an object by sending the object a *message*.
