### C++ JOURNEY

Welcome to my C++ learning repository ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey as I learn and practice in hopes of mastering (hopefully) C++. Here you'll find my notes, small projects and exercises that reflect my progress. My reference book will be Tony Gaddis's *Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures and Objects* (8th ed.)

Date & time of opening repository : 14/8/2024, 9:26pm

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming 
- Master the basics of C++ syntax and semantics
- Build small projects that are relevant to my learning experience
- Continuously improve coding practices and problem-solving skills

## How to use this repo?

Feel free to explore. I am a bit doubtful of it, but I hope my learning experience can be helpful to people who need the help. Feedback is always welcome, thank you.
